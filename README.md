This is intended as a desktop version of
[my browser music analysis tool](https://github.com/hlorenzi/musicanalysis),
allowing for more complex setups and level of control.
(Also because a statically-typed language makes all the difference...)

I'm planning support for the functional harmony analysis track,
multiple instrument tracks and sound synthesis modules,
and fine (visual!) control over note volume, pitch-bend, or any other arbitrary parameter.

Effectively, this would become a full-fledged music tracker,
with an emphasis on things I care most.
